# Glioblastoma_II
A set of codes and instructions for a follow-up study from our iScience (2022) results on pediatric glioblastoma.
Paper is currently under review in Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences (Springer).

To download the pediatric GBM scRNA seq expression counts (.csv) follow instructions from the iScience paper Uthamacumaran and Craig (2022)
Select all pGBM cells (1943 cells)

The manuscript : https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.03.560663v1 has the links and details of all other codes.

Once you open the ZIP folder with the codes, you will find the following:
1) Algorithmic K-Complexity Analysis Folder (with all the PID networks results using OACC BDM calculator for the graph network complexity analysis)
2) MuTrans Folder (has results, a sample data named Astro.mat, and the code tutorial example_mpp that needs to be run on MATLAB, using
the MuTrans-release-main code folder you can download from the original Nature Comm. paper website (See Manuscript Code and Data section))
3) PID Networks folder (with all network files)
4) Additional Code txt file (from the iScience 2022 paper, if needed)
5) Code for CellChat word document with codes for the immune-gioblastoma signaling crosstalk analysis
6) PID NETWORK INFERENCE CODE- word document with all network inference codes, Seurat clustering tutorial, and network analysis instructions.
